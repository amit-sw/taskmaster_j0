# Team Task Notes: Overall Testing Strategy

This document outlines the overall testing strategy for the Team Task Notes application. The goal is to ensure the delivery of a high-quality, reliable, secure, and user-friendly application by defining various testing levels, types, tools, and environments.

---

## 1. Levels of Testing

A multi-layered testing approach will be adopted to catch issues at different stages of development.

### 1.1. Unit Tests

*   **Focus:** Testing the smallest, isolated pieces of code (functions, methods, modules) to ensure they work correctly in isolation.
*   **Backend Components/Modules to Unit Test:**
    *   **API Helper Functions:** Any utility functions used for request parsing, response formatting, data validation, etc.
    *   **Business Logic in Services:** Core logic within services responsible for note management, user authentication, team management, sharing logic, notification generation, search query construction, etc. For example:
        *   Parsing logic for Slack slash command text (`/createnote title; content`).
        *   Parsing logic for email-in note creation (subject to title, body to content).
        *   Permission checking logic for note access.
        *   Logic for identifying notification recipients.
    *   **Database Interaction Logic (Mocks):** Functions responsible for constructing database queries or interacting with an ORM, using mocks for the actual database calls to test the logic itself.
    *   **Model Validation:** Validation rules defined on data models (e.g., user input validation for API requests).
*   **Frontend Components/Modules to Unit Test:**
    *   **Utility Functions:** Date formatting, input validation, data transformation utilities.
    *   **Individual UI Components (Logic):** Testing the logic within more complex UI components (e.g., a custom date picker, a filter component's state management) with mocked props and services.
    *   **State Management Logic:** If using a state management library (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Vuex), unit test reducers/mutations, actions, and selectors.

### 1.2. Integration Tests

*   **Focus:** Testing the interaction and data flow between different components or modules, including external services (with mocks where appropriate).
*   **Key Integration Points to Test:**
    *   **API Endpoint Request/Response Cycles:**
        *   Testing each API endpoint (`/api/notes`, `/api/users`, `/api/teams`, `/api/slack/*`, `/api/email/*`, `/api/admin/*`, etc.) by sending HTTP requests and verifying responses (status codes, JSON structure, data accuracy).
        *   This will involve mocking the database layer to control test data and avoid external dependencies during most API integration tests.
    *   **Frontend Component - Backend API Interaction:**
        *   Testing frontend services or components that make API calls to the backend, ensuring correct request formation and response handling. Mocking the HTTP requests (e.g., using `msw` - Mock Service Worker) to simulate API responses.
    *   **Third-Party Service Interactions (with Mocks):**
        *   **Slack API:** Simulate Slack OAuth flow callbacks, slash command payloads, and mock responses from `chat.postMessage` when testing notification sending logic.
        *   **Email Services (Inbound/Outbound):**
            *   Simulate webhook calls from the email provider for "email-in to create note" feature.
            *   Mock API calls to the transactional email service for sending notifications.
    *   **Database Integration (Selective):** While most API tests mock the DB, a separate suite of integration tests can verify that SQL queries or ORM operations work correctly against a real (test) database instance with controlled schema and data.

### 1.3. End-to-End (E2E) / UI Tests

*   **Focus:** Testing complete user flows from the user's perspective, simulating real user scenarios through the UI in a browser environment.
*   **Critical User Flows to Cover:**
    *   **User Account Management:**
        *   User registration and login.
        *   (Future) Password reset.
    *   **Core Note Management:**
        *   Creating a new note (with title, content, due date, priority, tags).
        *   Viewing a list of notes and a single note.
        *   Editing an existing note.
        *   Deleting a note.
        *   Adding/removing attachments to a note.
    *   **Sharing and Permissions:**
        *   Sharing a note with another user with specific permissions.
        *   Changing permissions for a shared note.
        *   Revoking access to a shared note.
        *   Making a note public to a team.
    *   **Team Management (if UI exists):**
        *   Creating a team.
        *   Adding a user to a team.
    *   **Search and Filtering:**
        *   Performing a full-text search and verifying relevant results.
        *   Applying various filters (status, priority, tags, user, date) and verifying the filtered list.
        *   (Future) Saving and applying a custom filter.
    *   **Admin Dashboard Functionality:**
        *   Viewing the team-wide notes list with filters.
        *   Viewing team participation summaries.
        *   Triggering and verifying CSV export (content verification might be limited, focus on successful download).
    *   **Slack Integration (Core Flow):**
        *   Initiating and completing the Slack connection OAuth flow (might be challenging for full E2E automation, may require partial mocking or specific test accounts).
        *   Verifying that a note created via Slack slash command appears in the TTN UI.
    *   **Email-in to Create Note (Core Flow):**
        *   Difficult to fully E2E test without a complex setup. Focus might be on API-level integration tests for the webhook, and manual E2E.

## 2. Types of Testing

### 2.1. Functional Testing

*   **Focus:** Verifying that all features and functionalities of the application work according to the specified requirements (PRD, API designs, UI designs). This is covered across unit, integration, and E2E tests.
*   **Examples:** Ensuring a created note saves with correct data, a shared user has the correct permissions, filters return the correct subset of notes.

### 2.2. Usability Testing

*   **Focus:** Assessing the ease of use, intuitiveness, and overall user experience (UX) of the application.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Heuristic Evaluation:** Evaluating the UI against established usability principles.
    *   **User Testing Sessions:** Observing real users (or internal team members acting as users) performing common tasks within the application to identify pain points, confusion, and areas for improvement.
    *   **Feedback Collection:** Gathering feedback through surveys or in-app feedback mechanisms.

### 2.3. Performance Testing

*   **Focus:** Evaluating the responsiveness, stability, and scalability of the application, particularly the backend APIs, under various load conditions.
*   **Key Areas:**
    *   **API Response Times:** Measuring latency for critical endpoints (e.g., `GET /api/notes` with complex filters, `POST /api/notes`, search queries).
    *   **Load Handling:** Testing how the system performs with concurrent users and a large volume of data.
    *   **Database Performance:** Identifying slow queries under load.
    *   **Frontend Performance:** Page load times, rendering speed for large lists (though less emphasis than backend for this type of app initially).

### 2.4. Security Testing

*   **Focus:** Identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities to protect user data and ensure application integrity.
*   **Key Areas:**
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Verifying that users can only access data and perform actions they are permitted to (e.g., cannot edit notes of others unless shared with edit permission, admin endpoints are protected).
    *   **Data Protection:** Ensuring sensitive data (like passwords, API keys, Slack access tokens) is securely stored (e.g., hashed passwords, encrypted tokens).
    *   **Input Validation:** Preventing common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection (SQLi) by validating and sanitizing all user inputs on both frontend and backend.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scanning third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **API Security:** Checking for issues like insecure direct object references (IDOR), rate limiting on sensitive actions.
    *   **Slack Integration Security:** Verifying Slack request signature validation.

### 2.5. Accessibility Testing (A11y)

*   **Focus:** Ensuring the application is usable by people with disabilities, aiming for compliance with standards like Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
*   **Key Areas:**
    *   **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements should be focusable and operable via keyboard.
    *   **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Semantic HTML, ARIA attributes where necessary, alternative text for images.
    *   **Color Contrast:** Sufficient contrast between text and background.
    *   **Responsive Design:** Ensuring usability across different zoom levels and screen sizes.

### 2.6. Compatibility Testing

*   **Focus:** Verifying that the application works correctly across different web browsers, operating systems, and devices (especially relating to responsive design).
*   **Key Areas:**
    *   **Cross-Browser:** Testing on latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
    *   **Device/Screen Size:** Testing on various screen resolutions and physical devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones) to ensure responsive design works as intended.

## 4. Test Environment Strategy

Different environments are crucial for isolating testing stages and ensuring stability.

*   **Development Environment:**
    *   Local developer machines.
    *   Used for coding, initial unit tests, and basic integration tests.
    *   May connect to local databases or mocked services.
*   **Staging / QA Environment:**
    *   A dedicated environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.
    *   Used for more comprehensive integration testing, E2E testing, UAT (User Acceptance Testing), performance testing, and security checks before release.
    *   Should have its own dedicated database, seeded with realistic (anonymized if necessary) data.
    *   Third-party integrations (Slack, Email) should point to test/sandbox accounts if available, or be carefully managed.
*   **Production Environment:**
    *   The live environment used by end-users.
    *   Monitoring and limited smoke testing occur here post-deployment. Hotfixes are applied here directly if critical.
