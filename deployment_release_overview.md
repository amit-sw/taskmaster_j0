## 1. Environment Preparation

Before deploying the application, the production environment must be meticulously prepared and configured.

### 1.1. Setting up Production Infrastructure

*   **Servers/Hosting:**
    *   **Application Servers:** Provision and configure servers to host the backend API and frontend application. This could involve Virtual Machines (VMs), container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm), or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions (e.g., Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine).
    *   **Web Servers:** Set up and configure web servers like Nginx or Apache if needed (often included in PaaS or handled by load balancers).
    *   **Load Balancers:** Implement load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple application server instances for scalability and high availability.
*   **Databases:**
    *   Set up the production database server (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
    *   Ensure it's optimized for performance, security (e.g., network restrictions, strong credentials), and has automated backups configured.
    *   Consider read replicas for scalability if high read traffic is anticipated.
*   **Networking:**
    *   Configure DNS records to point the application's domain name (e.g., `app.teamtasknotes.com`) to the load balancer or web server.
    *   Set up firewalls and security groups to restrict access to servers and databases only from necessary sources.
    *   Implement HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates (e.g., via Let's Encrypt or a commercial CA) for secure communication.
*   **Storage for Attachments:**
    *   Set up and configure a robust storage solution for user attachments (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage). Ensure appropriate permissions and backup strategies.
*   **Email Services:**
    *   Configure production accounts and settings for third-party email services (for sending notifications and receiving email-in notes). Ensure API keys are production-ready and domain verification (SPF, DKIM) is complete for good deliverability.
*   **Slack Integration:**
    *   Ensure the Slack App is configured with production URLs (OAuth redirect, slash command URLs) and has been approved or installed in target workspaces if applicable.

### 1.2. Configuration Management

*   **Environment Variables:**
    *   All environment-specific configurations should be managed through environment variables, NOT hardcoded into the application.
    *   This includes:
        *   Database connection URLs/credentials.
        *   API keys for third-party services (Slack, email providers, etc.).
        *   Application secrets (e.g., JWT signing key, session secret).
        *   Logging levels.
        *   Domain names and base URLs.
*   **Secure Storage of Secrets:** Use a secure mechanism for managing and injecting secrets into the production environment (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or platform-specific secret management).
*   **Configuration Consistency:** Ensure configuration is consistent across all production instances if running a distributed setup.

## 2. Deployment Strategy

Choosing the right deployment strategy helps minimize downtime and risk during releases.

### 2.1. Common Strategies (Brief Mention)

*   **Blue/Green Deployment:** Maintain two identical production environments ("Blue" and "Green"). Deploy to the inactive environment, test, then switch traffic. Allows for easy rollback.
*   **Canary Release:** Gradually roll out the new version to a small subset of users/servers first. Monitor for issues before expanding the rollout.
*   **Rolling Updates:** Update server instances one by one or in batches, ensuring some instances are always running the old version until the new ones are healthy.
*   **Recreate (Big Bang):** Stop the old version, deploy the new version. Simple but involves downtime. Generally not recommended for user-facing applications.

**Initial Choice:** For an initial release, a simpler strategy like "Recreate" (if a brief maintenance window is acceptable) or "Rolling Updates" (if using a PaaS or container orchestrator that supports it easily) might be chosen. Blue/Green or Canary are more advanced but offer better resilience.

### 2.2. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline

*   **Setup:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI).
*   **CI (Continuous Integration) Phase:**
    *   Automated builds on every code commit to the main branches.
    *   Automated running of unit tests and integration tests.
    *   Static code analysis and linting.
    *   Building deployment artifacts (e.g., Docker images).
*   **CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery) Phase:**
    *   Automated deployment to staging/QA environment after successful CI.
    *   Automated deployment to production environment (can be manual trigger for initial releases or for critical changes).
    *   The pipeline should handle tasks like fetching dependencies, running database migrations, building frontend assets, and deploying backend/frontend code.

## 3. Pre-Release Checklist

A thorough checklist ensures all critical aspects are covered before going live.

*   **Final Testing:**
    *   **Smoke Tests:** Perform a quick set of tests on the production-like environment (ideally staging that mirrors production) to ensure core functionalities are working as expected. This is a sanity check.
    *   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** If applicable, have key stakeholders or a small group of beta users test the application in the staging environment.
    *   Verify all automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) are passing on the release candidate build.
*   **Data Migration (if applicable):**
    *   If migrating data from an older system or a staging database used for content creation, plan and test the data migration script thoroughly.
    *   Ensure data integrity and perform a dry run if possible.
*   **Backup Procedures:**
    *   Verify that automated database backup procedures are in place and working correctly for the production database.
    *   Perform a manual backup just before deployment for an extra safety net.
    *   Ensure a rollback plan for the database schema (migrations) and application code is documented.
*   **Monitoring and Logging Setup:**
    *   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Integrate an APM tool (e.g., Sentry, New Relic, Datadog, Dynatrace) to monitor application performance, track errors, and get insights into transaction traces.
    *   **Logging:** Ensure structured logging is implemented for both backend and frontend. Logs should be centralized (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, Loggly, Papertrail) and searchable. Set appropriate log levels for production.
    *   **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Set up monitoring for server resources (CPU, memory, disk), database performance, and network traffic.
    *   **Alerting:** Configure alerts for critical errors, high resource usage, or application downtime.
*   **Preparing Marketing/Communication Materials (PRD Launch Goals):**
    *   Prepare blog posts, social media announcements, email newsletters to users (if an existing user base for a beta).
    *   Update website/landing page with information about the launch.
    *   Prepare support documentation, FAQs, and tutorials.
*   **Security Review:**
    *   Final check of security configurations (firewalls, SSL certificates).
    *   Ensure all secrets and API keys are for the production environment and securely managed.
*   **DNS TTL:** Consider lowering DNS Time-To-Live (TTL) values for the application's domain records before the launch to allow for quicker propagation if IP addresses need to change.
